            As course Curriculum is designed by the University which generally lags behind advances in technology, thecollege will continue to teach new relevant technologies outside the curriculum and devote at least 25% of students time outside prescribed curriculum.

          <p> Focus in next few years: Efforts will be made to increase industry partnerships and industry alignment so that students are industry ready by the time they complete the course. This will include industry certifications and courses, Project based learning, internships , participation in Hackathons etc. Students will be provided with the opportunity to work in the industry in 7th and 8th semester ( on the lines of Practice School at BITS).
          Faculty is the biggest strength of this institute. There will be more focus on FDP’s , Research papers and patents by faculty , faculty visits to universities in India and abroad for joint research and projects. college will substantially finance these activities. Academic leave will be granted to faculty pursuing PhD when required so that most faculty complete their PhD in next 5 years.

          To understand the needs of the industry and transform students into well trained fully employable engineering graduates with rigorous academic knowledge and industry required skill sets. All trustees of NJR Foundation and Management of educational Institutes promoted by NJR shall abide by the following core values :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To run professionally managed educational institutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              To pursue excellence in teaching & research.
            </li>
            <li>
              To follow best practices and provide transparency in the governance of institutes promoted by NJR.

            </li>
            <li>
              To follow a fair and just admission process so as to provide access to good education for all sections of society.
            </li>
            <li>
              To create world-class infrastructure in the Institutions promoted by the Foundation.
            </li>
            <li>
              To provide free education to the disadvantaged sections of society. 
            </li>
         
          </ul>
          <p>
            Techno India NJR has been founded by 2 Founder Trustees – one a housewife who lost her only child and husband and another a BITS Pilani graduate. The institute therefore will continue to emphasize Philanthropic activities in memory of departed souls and implement Best practices of eminent Institutes like BITS.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to 5% seats allocated by the Institute under the Tuition Fees Waiver Scheme( TFWS), Institute will continue to increase its allocation for Fees concessions (under various heads up to 100% fees waiver) from the present level of around 10% of the revenue (between 40-50 lakh per annum) to around 25% of revenue in next 10 years so that bright students from needy families get a chance to undertake engineering education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Institute has been investing 80% of its surplus (Income minus expenditure) in upgradation of its infrastructure for implementing new technologies and will continue to do so in future. The institute will create more incubation centers within the campus from 2 at present to 5 in next 5 years to promote Startup culture in the institute. The institute will also invest upto 10% in the equity of the institute Start-ups
