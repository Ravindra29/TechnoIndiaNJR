                   <p> Techno NJR selected for Aricent Employability Programme</p>
                </h3>
                      <p>India has highest number of engineering graduates and the industry currently employs about 2.5 million every year. The industry might employ more than 5.5 million and its size will reach $225 billion by the end of 2020. So there is need to skill students and this new initiative will impact tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Techno India NJR is one of the few colleges chosen by Aricent and NASSCOM for this unique program.

                            Around 2500 college students are expected to benefit from this upskilling exercise, which will be delivered through vocational training providers and governed by the NASSCOM Foundation. This on-campus programme will equip students, in select cities and colleges, with skills in specialised areas, such as JAVA, testing and software development, among others, enabling them to find employment across the IT-BPM industry. The candidates will be assessed on the NDSC-SSC NASSCOM Qualification Parameters (QP) and certified on the relevant job role, enhancing the chances of employment.
